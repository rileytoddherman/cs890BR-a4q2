Dependencies:
    You will need a c++ compiler (I use g++) and cmake installed. Here is a list of libraries that are used:
        iostream
        vector
        set
        exception

Files:
    In order of dependency, starting with the least dependent:
        empty_domain_exception.h 
        domain.h 
        csp.h 
        backtrack.h 
        main.cpp
        Makefile

How to use this program:
    I've included a Makefule for your convenience. The following commands are provided, along with descriptions:
        make docs: displays this file
        make clean: removes object files and executable
        make build: builds the objects and creates the executeable
        make run: runs the program
        make snapshot: used in development to place a copy of the program in a temporary folder
